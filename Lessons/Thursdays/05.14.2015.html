<title>"God Will Make a Way" - 05/14/2015</title>

<p>One of the most amazing things about God is that he always will make a way for us. This is true no matter the case and rings true throughout all of scripture. Yes, I said <i>all</i> of scripture. This is one of the amazing things that I love about our Lord. It is the fact that he loves us so much that he makes a road for us in many different situations no matter how much we sin. Through salvation and even our daily lives, God always makes a way.</p>
<p>For starters, he has made a way for salvation. Romans 1:16-17 says "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith." His power is so great and mighty, that is can do anything. He even created everything by speaking words! (Genesis 1:3 says "And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.") That has to be some amazing power, wouldn't you agree?</p>
<p>He is capable of using His power without becoming corrupted because He is the incorruptible one. He cannot sin. Due to this, He is always delivering us from evil. He does this because He loves us. Psalms 34:17 says "The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.</p>
<p>Throughout the scripture, we find stories where God has made a way for us no matter the circumstance. No matter how much you may sin, he still loves you unconditionally and makes those roads for you to follow. Ephesians 1:4-6 says "According as he hath chosen un in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved." Philippians 2:13 says "For it is God which worketh in your both to will and to do of his good pleasure."</p>
<p>Think of one person that you care about <i>a lot</i>. Who exactly this person is, it does not matter. Are they your best friend, your spouse, your parent, sibling, etc.? What does matter is that you care about this person. Now, wouldn't you go through extraordinary lengths to help them and/or make them happy? God loves us so much. He loves us so much that he loves to see us happy. He does not want to see us sad.</p>
<p>Because He does not want to see us sad and because He loves us so much, He has always made some way for people to get to heaven when they die. For us, all we have to do is believe in one thing, His big sacrifice, giving up His own life, when He deserved life, so that we could be happy. That's one heck of a sacrifice. Romans 6:23 says "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." What does this salvation entail? It means remission of sins past, present, and future. Because we have the remission of sins for believing He died and rose again for our sins, we won't go to Hell when we die. We will go to Heaven. Do you believe this? Maybe this next verse will convince you - Revelation 21:4 - "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, no more sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away." This is what will happen when us believers reach Heaven.</p>
<p>In heaven, I want to share that experience with people. I want to see people saved from an eternity in Hell, so that is why I work on this app. It may not reach a lot of people, but somehow, I believe by the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, it can do what God wants it to do. Romans 1:16 says "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth: to the Jew first, and also to the Greek."</p>
