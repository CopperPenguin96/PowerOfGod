<title>Words Are Power - 05/21/2015</title>

<p>Sorry about the lesson update delay today. There has been a lot going on.</p>
<p>Let's jump right in. Throughout the scripture, we are told of God's <i>amazing</i> power. You know this and I know this. Romans 1:16 says - "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek." The scripture is very clear about salvation, but one might be asking at this point "What does this have to do with words" and that is a good question.</p>
<p>Let's answer that good question! Genesis 1:3 says "And God said, Let there be light: and there was light." All of creation, (yes, all of it!), was made by God himself speaking words! That is amazing! The entire Bible, (God's Holy Word, is words!) Words started everything, hold everything together, create life, create hope, and do so many amazing things!</p>
<p>We believe that the entire Bible is true. 2 Timothy 3:16 says "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness." Word for word, the scripture is true! That's thousands upon thousands of words (here is a close amount: 12,143). That is amazing power there!</p>
<p>We believe that the Bible is God's Word, which makes it true, and that it has always existed. John 1:1 says "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." Being that it is true, and 100% honest and 100% God, consider these: God has amazing power, the Gospel means "Good News", and the Gospel is in God's Word. This makes the Gospel "Powerful Good News". Let's look again at Romans 1:16 - "FOr I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek." THe Gospel is important because it tells of what Jesus did. This shows that <i>words</i> can bring people to salvation.</p>
<p>Words can actually hurt people, though! Aside from the scripture, words can actually hurt those in our daily lives. Proverbs 15:1-2;4 - "A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grevious words stir up anger, The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness... A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein in a breach in the spirit."</p>
<p>Words can also lead us away from God, (not our salvation though). This is in regards to false prophets, or teachers with error. False propheths are people who know the truth, but speak lies about it. For instance, if a pastor who knows that the blood of Jesus Christ being shed for our sins played an important role in the salvation circumstance, yes then says to people "The blood has no significance" would be a false prophet. If there was no blood, then we would not have our salvation. 2 Timothy 2:16 says "But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness."</p>
<p>Now, just because someone says something wrong, it doesn't make them a false prophet. They could really honestly be believing what they are saying. Hence, we call them a "teacher with error." Did you know that we are all this? No one is going to be a perfect preacher or minister of witnesser to the lost world, (Besides God Himself). We are not God. Even words I have said could be wrong.</p>
<p>Someone's faith can be utterly destroyed by words. One such example is someone who says the Rapture had already passed and that we are all "left behind." 2 Timothy 2:18 says "Who concerning the faith have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrown the faith of one." That is sad that someone would give up their faith because someone told them that the Rapture has already happened.</p>
<p>Know also that words can lead people to Jesus. Romans 10:14 says - "How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?" Use those words to teach someone about God. Who knows? Maybe heaven will get a  bit bigger!</p>
