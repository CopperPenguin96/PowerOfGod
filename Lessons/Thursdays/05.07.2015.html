<title>"Humble Is It? Or Pride?" - 05/07/2015</title>

<p>Sorry about the lack of updating lessons for the past week or so. I just got done with school last week and have been trying to get the Windows Store version of the app released.</p>
<p>Today we are going to cover a couple verses: Colossians 3:13 and Proverbs 29:23.<p>
<p>Colossians 3:13 says "Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye."<p>
<p>Forbearing means <i>sustaining</i>, holding up; enduring. Quarrel means a resentful disagreement or a grudge. I find this verse very import because these are important things for one who believes in Christ and what He did on Calvary near a close 2,000 years ago.</p>
<p>As believers, we want to live Christ-Like, meaning sticking by each other and always forgiving them, as Jesus has done for us. Ephesians 4:32 says "And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you." You want them to see Christ in you? How about treat others has Christ has treated you? This means our enemies too.</p>
<p>Proverbs 29:23 says - "A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit."</p>
<p>Humble means low in rank, meek, or abase. We are to be "humble" when serving the Lord.</p>
<p>Pride is a dangerous thing with mankind. Some widely known examples are the Jewish people or the Tower of Babel. People tried to make a tower to become higher than God. They believed they could, but God struck it down by creating mass confusion by creating different languages and cultures among the people, (hence why we have such differences).</p>
<p>These two verses are important because if you aren't humble, aren't respectful, and are not without a lot of pride, people won't see Christ in you, thus your testimony for Jesus Christ is ruined! People will think when they find out you are Christian will think "Oh him? A Christian? Is that how all Christians are?" That's not what we want do we? Our lives are supposed to be dedicated to Christ after we are saved. That means we humble ourselves to serve Christ, respect one another, forgive others, and lower our pride, because God is the all powerful God. His ways are higher than our ways. His thoughts are higher than our thoughts.</p>
