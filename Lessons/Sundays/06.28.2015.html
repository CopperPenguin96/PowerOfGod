<head><title>Satan is the Biggest Deceiver - 06/28/2015</title></head>
<body><p>Back to the lessons it is. Sorry about the lack of updates within the app. Here is the first sunday lesson in a while, and we are going to talk about the lies of Satan and the world.</p></body>
<p>The world is filled with the things are aren't true. Satan is the root of this. He loves to lie to us to get us to believe what he wants us to believe. 2 Corinthians 4:4 says "In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them." Satan's plan is against God, so salvation of people from Hell is not what he wants. He will attempt to influence the world that the Bible isn't true.</p>
<p>Everyday, you can see the lies that Satan has imposed on our world. 2 Corinthians 4:8 says "We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair."</p>
<p>The most lies involve how everything is made. Genesis 1:1 says "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." Atheists say nothing did. Muslims say Allah did. However, the truth is found in the Bible - the 100% true word of God Almighty!</p>
<p>2 Timothy 3:16 says "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness." John 1:1-4 tell us "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men." The truth can only be found in the Bible! Genesis 1:1 again says "In the beginning <b>GOD</b> created the heaven and the earth." It wasn't Allah. It wasn't nothing. It wasn't anything else. It was <b>GOD</b>!</p>
<p>Satan does not want us to believe that God created it all. If we believe that God did, it is possible that we believe Jesus Christ died for our sins and rose 3 days later. John 3:16 tell us that "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."</p>
<p>Once we believe, wwe will go to Heaven when we die. We won't lose this salvation from Hell. Ephesians 2:8-9 actually says "For by grace are ye saved through faith: and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast." If we could lose our salvation, it would then become a work.</p>
