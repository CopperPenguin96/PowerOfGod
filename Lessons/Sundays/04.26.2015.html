<p>Today we are going to cover the highlights of Psalms 37. It is a very good chapter in concerning the fact that it shows that we can trust the Lord with everything. He protects us in every high and stormy gale.</p>
<h3>In the Lord</h3>
<p>Verse 3 - "Trust in the LORD, and do good: so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shall be fed."</p>
<p>Verse 4 - "Delight thyself in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart."</p>
<p>Verse 5 - "Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass."</p>
<p>Verse 7 - "Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass."</p>
<h3>What He Does</h3>
<p>Verse 18 - "The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be forever."</p>
<p>Verse 23 - "The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD, and he delighteth in his way."</p>
<p>Verse 24 - "Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth with his hand."</p>
<p>Verse 25 - "I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread."</p>
<p>Verse 33 - "The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged." </p>
<p>Verse 38 - "But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off."</p>
