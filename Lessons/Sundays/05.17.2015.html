<title>Heaven - 05/17/2015</title>

<p>Today, we are going to talk about Heaven and what is. There are many disputes in Christendom today (Christendom = main stream Christianity) that has caused mass confusion as to what the Bible really says about certain topics. Here are some questions that are going to be answered in this lesson: What is Heaven and what does it mean to us? What does Paul the Apostle say about Heaven? These are things we are going to cover today about Heaven.</p>
<p>From the beginning of time, we know there has been a heaven. We know this because God created it. Genesis 1:1 says "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." Notice that in this verse that it says "heaven" and not "heavens." Many Bible versions, in order to match the concept of multiple heavens, make this into "heavens." This is why I prefer the King James Version, because it sticks to the original translations. You do not need to modify this word if you pay attention to what the chapter says. You must notice that Genesis 1 is in chronological order, meaning 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. Straight off the Bible gets right into the action. Genesis 1:1 isn't a topic sentence, per se, but is the first step God took in creating all that would ever exist.</p>
<p>Because the Bible says this, I automatically will tell you that it is true. What is says is true and cannot tell a lie, because it is <i>God's</i> Word. Heaven is real and so is Hell. Many people will try to disprove that Hell really existed. They will tell you it is just symbolism for "death" and the "grave." Well, I tell you that is false. Hell is real. If the reward of salvation is eternal life in paradise, what is the punishment of not obtaining that salvation? It is eternal life in Hell! If Hell does not exist, it throws off the entire balance that God created, and will let people continue and say Heaven does not exist. If you let them blot one bit out as not real, it gives them permission to destroy the rest.</p>
<p>Now that we know the Heaven is real, where exactly is this "Heaven." You could say that the "Heaven" you are thinking of is in a different realm, sort of like the stories of Narnia, where there are multiple worlds and such. Before we continue, you must know that there are 3 different heavens.  You now may be thinking what a fraud I am. You are also probably saying that I said in Genesis 1:1 there is only 1 heaven. You must have misinterpreted what I said. That was at that point of time. Did you know that the Bible continues, that it isn't just one verse?</p>
<p>Heaven, what we know as the "Glory Land" is called the third heaven.  It is the amazing city where we each will have our own place that God has designed specifically for us. Then, there is the second heaven, which is space. Finally, there is the first heaven, being the sky. The first heaven was made first (of course), as described in Genesis 1:1. God created the firmament, (which is found in Genesis 1, and just means the sky) and the stars, which I have described as the "other" heavens.</p>
<p>Now, if you remember from our lesson on Rightly Dividing, there is what is called the Kingdom Dispensation. If you don't remember or did not know of this lesson, let's take a crash course real quick. Rightly Dividing is found in 2 Timothy 2:15 which says "Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth." There are 7 major dispensations in the Bible (dispensation = time period in which God handles humanity in a specific way) which are meant to be divided. We are currently in the Dispensation of Grace (Acts 9-Philemon). The Kingdom Dispensation, which entails Hebrews-Revelation, is the last dispensation in the Bible. This dispensation takes place <i>after</i> the Rapture of the church. The Rapture is when Jesus comes back to take all who believed to Heaven.</p>
<p>The Kingdom Dispensation was not meant for us, the Body of Christ, but for the Nation of Israel after we are gone and in paradise, because Israel is still God's chosen nation and still wants to deal with them and give them an opportunity for salvation even though they have turned their backs on Him so many different times. We must understand that this is a future time and not now.</p>
<p>Because we know that the "Kingdom Dispensation" is meant for the nation of Israel and not the Body of Christ, we must also now understand that this is not Heaven. The Kingdom is not Heaven! By referring to what it is called, we can assume that this dispensation will most likely include the "kingdom." How can the kingdom be Heaven and we be gone and still be here on earth with the Israelis? It can't. We now know that the Kingdom refers to the kingdom that God will establish here on earth after the tribulation (as the scripture says. Do also know that the tribulation is in the same dispensation. The tribulation happens after the Rapture). Yet, people will try to dispute my claim here and quote this verse from John (being John 18:36) - "Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my  kingdom not from hence." People will say it won't be in this world because of this verse, but I say they didn't read the verse correctly.</p>
<p>As believers we are told not to be of this world. We are walking in it, but are not of this world. What does this mean? It means that while we are in it, we know that we cannot have our salvation taken by the sins and lusts of this world. The same applies to the kingdom. It isn't of this world, it won't be of the world. It won't have the sinful lusts and desires that we know the world has.</p>
<p>Let's continue talking about Heaven now, enough with the kingdom. Heaven is where God is making each of us our own special place for all who believe. Heaven is special because it will not have any sorrow, pain, guilt, sin, etc. It will be perfect. Let's look at Revelation Chapter 21, (the second-to-last chapter of the Bible).</p>
<p> <h3>Revelation 21:1-8</h3></p>
<p><ol>
<li>And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.</li>
<li>And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</li>
<li>And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God, is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.</li>
<li>And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.</li>
<li>And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.</li>
<li>And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water oflife freely.</li>
<li>He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.</li>
<li>But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want further reading into Chapter 21, you will find a description of the Kingdom which is to be here on Earth. And what you just read, is what will happen in the kingdom, but why am I showing you this? Well, that is because at that point in time, we will have already been in Heaven! We will have already experienced something like this! No more sorrow and such.</p>
<p>I want us to now look at the last verse in this chapter, which is Revelation 21:27 - "And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life." This is true for both the kingdom and of Heaven. So, what does it mean to be written in the Book of Life? What is the Book of Life?</p>
<p>The book of life contains the list of all those saved by grace! Revelation 20:15 says - "And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire." The Lake of Fire is <b>Hell</b>! You might be asking, "How do I get my name in the Book of Life? I don't want to go to Hell!"</p>
<p>All you have to do is believe that Jesus died and rose again for you! Romans 6:23 says "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." Romans 3:23-24 says "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus."</p>
<p>After being written in the Book of Life, you will not be removed, <i>ever</i>. Romans 8:37-39 says "Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."</p>
