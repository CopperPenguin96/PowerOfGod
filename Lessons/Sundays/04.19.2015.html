<title>The Blood - 4/19/2015</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>According to Romans 3:23, all have sinned. "For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God." That's a pretty bold statement. And to start, it started with Adam's sin. Today we are going to cover the most important concept of salvation - the blood. (Don't listen to false prophets when they say the blood is not important. It is) We will uncover what is sin and give you an understanding of the Blood of Christ.</p>
<p>So what is sin? To Christians, sin is anything that can prevent a growing relationship with God. The dictionary has 3 defintions.
    <ul>	<li>transgression of devine law</li>
<li>any act regarded as such a transgression of some religious or moral principle.</li>
<li>any reprehensible or regrettable action, behavior, lapse, etc.; great fault or offense.</li></ul>
The first 2 definitions match us. The 3rd one is good, but doesn't really fit the context all too well.</p>
<p>Imagine you are a grade school student in class. How do you get along with the teacher? You do what they say to do!</p>
<p>I remember in high school, I had a really awesome French teacher. I did as she said. I did the work and turned it in on time. We talked outside of school. I communicate with her on Facebook now, mostly about God.</p>
<p>Now, imagine what happens when you obey what God says to do! You grow in a relationship with God. </p>
<p>So, what are God's commandments? What does he expect us to do? It is the way of the right. The law is to be followed, for instance, if it pertained to killing or such, but if it pertained to stuff like salvation, not always is the law accurate in today's time. What God commands is what we are supposed to do.</p>
<p>What is disobeying then? It prevents a growing relationship with God. Does this sound any bit of familiar to you? Just a little?</p>
<p>Let's look again at Romans 3:23 - "For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God;" It is still a really powerful verse. Then look at verses 24-25 - "Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;" The blood is important! There is no salvation without the blood!</p>
<p>Let's look at the story of Cain and Abel. Cain and Abel were Adam and Eve's kids, before Seth. Cain was the older brother. Abel was the younger brother. Both of these boys loved the Lord very much. Genesis 4:1-5 says this "And Adam knew Even his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD. And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. And in the process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground a offering unto the LORD. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering. But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was wroth, and his countenance fell." The point here is that Abel gave up a lamb and Cabel gave up crop. What's the difference? Abel gave blood, Cain didn't.</p>
<p>Why blood, though? You may be thinking that this might be violent for such a loving god. Well, let's look at Romans 6:23 - "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." Death? Where's the blood in this? You might be asking this very question.</p>
<p>Many won't think of the heart. People will say that they could have died another way than a heart problem and they are right. While this may be true, the heart is the center of your life. What happens when you die? The heart stops. Your <b>blood</b> is finished.</p>
<p>So, let's look again at Romans 6:23 - "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." Now, do you see the blood in that verse?</p>
<p>Jesus was killed. He willingly laid down his own life for us. You may be asking, how can one man's blood cover all our sins? It can't, however, not only was Jesus 100% man, he was also 100% the One True God, the mighty Jehovah, the Great I Am, GOD HIMSELF! God cannot sin, but because he received death (again - Romans 6:23), it created so much amazing power! The Gates of Hell were broken open. The Devil had lost. The Messiah rose from the grave. It provided the gift of salvation for all sins - past, present, and future, provided that you believe he died and rose again.</p>
<p>Believing in Jesus dying and raising from the dead is sufficient to cover your sins. This is grace, God's grace. Grace away from blood. It isn't works, professing your faith multiple times, sacrifice, church membership, going to church baptism, etc. It is believing. After you believe, your salvation cannot be removed.</p>
