<title>Cornerstone - 06/07/2015</title>

<p>Sorry for the long period of time of no lessons. There has been <i>a lot</i> going on around here.</p>
<p>So, let's jump in. Today we are going to talk about what makes Jesus Christ our "Cornerstone". I'm sure at some point you have heard Him called this. There is even a popular song called "Cornerstone" by Hillsong.</p>
<p>Not a lot of people know what this means. Let's look into what the definitions are for "cornerstone."</p>
<p><ol><li>a stone untiring two walls at an intersection.</li>
<li>a stone representing the nominal place in the construction of a monumental building, usually carved with the date and laid with appropiate ceremonies.</li>
<li>something that is essential, indispensable, or basic.</li>
<li>the chief foundation on which something is constructed or developed.</li></ol></p>
<p>Our lesson today will be based on definitions #3 and #4. They both explain who Jesus is as a "cornerstone" and explain how our faith is to be based around this "cornerstone."</p>
<p>Christ is the Cornerstone. Ephesians 2:20 says "And are build upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone." He is the very basis of our faith. With no Christ, there is no us. Without Jesus you have nothing. With Jesus you have everything.</p>
<p>Christ is essential. Without him, you have nothing, as I have already said. John 6:35 says "And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger: and he that believeth on me shall never thirst."</p>
<p>Christ is indispensable. You cannot get rid of Christ, because He is God! Colossians 2:9 says "For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the God head bodily." Jesus is God. God can't be removed. It's simple!</p>
<p>Christ is basic. The way to Christ is basic, despite what Satan tries to tell you. One of Lucifer's biggest lies is that it can't be that simple as what people say. When I have talked about salvation in the past, Satan could be telling you "It's not that simple!" Many Christians have fallen into this trap of believing the Devil's lie. (i.e. Jehovah's Witnesses)</p>
<p>Believing that Jesus Christ died and rose again for your sins is enough. So, how do we know this?</p>
<p><ul><li>Romans 3:23 - 25 says "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth to be propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;"</li>
        <li>Romans 3:10 says "As it is written, There is none righteous, no not one:"</li>
        <li>Romans 6:23 says "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of GOd is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."</li>
        <li>Romans 5:8 says "But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."</li>
        <li>Romans 5:9 says "Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him."</li>
        <li>Romans 10:13 says "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."</li>
        </ul></p>
<p>It is the basic truth -> believe and you will go to heaven. This is you being saved from an eternity in Hell! This is why we praise God! The way isn't baptism, works, church membership, etc. It is believing and believing alone. Ephesians 2:8-9 says "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast." And because of this, we know we can never lose our salvation. If we were able to lose our salvation, then we would have to believe again and again and again, thus becoming works.</p>
