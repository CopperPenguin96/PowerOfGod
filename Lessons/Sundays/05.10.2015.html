<title>Our Great Big God - 05/10/2015</title>

<p>John 3:16 (while under law, contains a good message that Paul even teaches), is an amazing verse that I always tell people when trying trying to witness to people about Jesus Christ and what he did for us so many years ago. It says "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." That is an amazing love right there. Throughout all of history, you will never find a greater love than that.</p>
<p>You're probably thinking, yeah, now give me something from Paul! Romans 3:23-24 says "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:" Still needing more of Paul's writing in the scripture? Let's look at Romans 6:23 - "For the wages of sin <i>is</i> death; but the gift of God <i>is</i> eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. I can go on with many verses from Paul's epistles that explain this one truth.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, we forget things like this. We forget how big and great our amazing God is. We seem to think our problems are too big for him. We are forgetting the greatness of our God.</p>
<p>I want you to watch this video of the solar system. It is an amazing video because it shows how little we are compared to the universe. Just, think, our amazing God is so much bigger than everything you see in this video. This video can also be used to show the existance of God because it shows a giant thing, all in perfect, working, order. That had to have been made by <i>somebody</i>. And to think, a God so big came down to be a man, Jesus Christ, just to save us from hell. That is an amazing love. That is truly beautiful.</p>

<p>Now that you have watched the video, what do you think of God now? Are you ready to serve Him for His mighty love for you? Do you believe He can do anything? Do you believe that He is strong? Philippians 4:13 - "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me."</p>
