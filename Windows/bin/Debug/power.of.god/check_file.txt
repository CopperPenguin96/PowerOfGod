<head><title>Conflicted: The World - 05/15/2016 - Alex</title></head>

<p>I'm sorry about the lack of lessons for the past couple of weeks. That falls on my issue. I had become lazy in uploading lessons.</p>
<p>As we learned a couple of weeks ago, there seems to be a conflict between Law and Grace. This week, however, I want us to see the conflict between us as believers and the World. I want you to see the differences between God and Satan. Satan is very good at deceiving people. However, all believers should be glorifying God in all things. Romans 12:1-2 says, "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God."</p>
<p>In order to do this, you show fellowship and work with fellow believers. Surround yourselves with them. Psalm 1:1 contains a principle truth - "Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful." I think that it is so very important to associate with other believers.</p>
<p>Look at Romans 12:4-5 - "For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office: So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another." The Body of Christ must function together as one. When we do, it makes it hard for Satan to work. My friend from work, Hayley once told me that it is not going about to Jim's or Bob's church, since when we all go up there we will be under one Lord.</p>
<p>Even in a good church setting, believers do not use their God given gifts. He gave us these gifts for a reason. They, when used for God, keep us from the World. Look at Romans 12:6-8 - "Having then gifts according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophecy according to the proportion of faith; Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering, or he that teacheth, on teaching, Or he that exhortheth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness." Before you start jumping on this passage, understand that prophecy is no longer a thing. For us today it is just a point. It is a point to Paul's message that he was conveying. Use your gifts for the glory of God! (1 Corinthians 10:31; ch. 12)</p>
<p>Let your affection and love be sincere! Romans 12:9 says, "Let your love be without disimulation. Abhor that which is evi; ccleave to that which is good." Turn from what God's Word says is wrong, (1 Corinthians 10:13). Do you know why it is so hard to find a true love that will treat you right? We are dealing with a day and age where this world just won't stop turning from God. The principles of God are what drive a healthy relationship.</p>
<p>Regardless of who you are dealing with, (best friend, significant other, spouse, enemy, or anyone), remember these following verses:</p>
<ul><li>Romans 12:10 - "Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another;" There is no exceptions. Don't exclude someone from this just because they sin differently than you do! For all have sinned!</li>
<li>Romans 12:11 - "Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;" Your daily activities should all be dedicated to God, not in part or in laziness. Much too many times, I find myself being too lazy about my responsibilities.</li>
<li>Romans 12:12 - "Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer." Hope is a marvelous thing. Patience in trials is a virtue. God works through these things in prayer. Prayer is such a powerful thing. Is it talking to the GREAT I AM!</li>
<li>Romans 12:13 - "Distributing to the necessity of the saints; given to hospitality." The local church is supposed to act as the hands and feet of the Body of Christ. We can't focus on our theological differences. We have to open our arms out and share the g ospel.</li>
<li>Romans 12:14 - "Bless them which persecute you: bless and curse not." In this life, there will be those who persecute us. The best thing we can do is forgive them and show them the love of Christ. It may be the only way that they will see the truth.</li>
<li>Romans 12:15 - "Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weeep." God works the best through worship. He dries the tears of the believers.</li>
<li>Romans 12:16 - "Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits." Pride is a dangerous thing. It destroys relationships. It even got Satan in troiuble and he can use it against you.</li>
<li>Romans 12:17 - "Recompense to no man evil for evil, Provide things honest in the sight of all men." As I stated before, we are to love all.</li>
<li>Romans 12:18 - "It if be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men." Paul emphasized so much about caring for other. This is because our job is to love and to share the gospel! Love is the Gospel, is God, is the way He shows the Gospel.</li>
<li>Romans 12:19 - "Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mind; I will repay, saith the Lord." If God was fair, we'd all be in Hell right now. yet, His grace is all sufficient to wash all our sins away.</li>
<li>Romans 12:20 - "Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thrist, give him drink: for in doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head."</li>
<li>Romans 12:21 - "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."</li></ul>
<p>The Christian walk is about love: the love of Christ working in us. It is the one thing that separates us from the World. This is the only thing that will overcome the World. Act like you've been changed (Romans 12:3), and show the World the love of Jesus Christ, the Messiah!</p>
