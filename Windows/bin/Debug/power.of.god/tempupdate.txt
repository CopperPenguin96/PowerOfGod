		<body><p>Managers, CEO's, pastors, parents, kings, presidents, etc. This is directed to you. Your positions are examples of leadership. The responsibility of these leaders is to be a good example in their field. All around the world, leaders are destroying their operation and are turning their back on God. It is being ignored and hast to stop being ignored. Leaders need to step up to their responsibilities, or step down. As a leader you should be leading by example to those under you. If you cannot be a good example, you are unfit to be a leader, regardless of education, (Ephesians 5:1-2 - "Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour. But fornication, and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. For this ye know, that no whoremonger nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God."
</p>
<p>You need to, as a leader, ask yourself a couple of questions. Are you leading by example? have you put the past where it belongs? Your responses to these questions are vitally important.
</p>
<p>Do not forget that people watch their leaders. They will follow your leadership blindly (Ephesians 5:8). Walking as children of light means to lead by example by following God! (1 Corinthians 10:31) If what you are doing is not for God's glory, then why are you doing it? It is not setting a good example!
</p>
<p>To be a good example, the past must stay in the past! You can't bring it back up! It's too dangerous! (Philippians 3:13-14) We can't go forward for Christ if we stay in our past. Forgive what others have done and forgive yourself. Our pasts are filled with the things of this world. Bringing up past ins and/or events allows for those under your leadership to use it against you.
</p>
<p>It is very important that you step up to the plate as a leader and lead by example. If you are not, then either fix your situations or step down. It is that simple. If you do not, God will most certainly find someone else to assume your position. (Colossians 3:23-25, 1 Samuel 15:23)</p></body></html>
