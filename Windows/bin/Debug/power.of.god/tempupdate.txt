    <title>"Righty Dividing Week #2: The Dispensation of Innocence" - 10/11/2015 - Alex</title>

<p>On the first week in this series, we covered some basic information on dispensationalism. Today, however, we are going to go in depth on the first dispensation in the scripture. That is the Dispensation of Innocence. This dispensation is possibly the smallest of the seven. Its entirety is Genesis 1-3.</p>
<p>Every week in this series we are going to cover the <b>Three Major Questions</b>. Below are the questions and the answers as they apply to this dispensation.
</p>
<p><ul>
        <li>To whom was it wrote? <b>Jews</b></li>
        <li>What was the purpose? <b>To explain the beginnings of creation, good, and evil.</b></li>
        <li>How did God handle the people in it? <b>He walked in the Garden of Eden with them. His intention was for no sin.</b></li></ul>
</p>
<p>Atheists use Genesis the most against Christians today. Newer Bible versions destroy it. But we know that in Genesis 1:1, God made all. Genesis 1:1 - "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." It was only God who could. Throughout Genesis 1, you find the <i>truth</i> of how all was made. Here God demonstrates power by <i>speaking</i> everything into existance. Yes, that's right! Everything was made by the word of God!
</p>
<p>Here is the oder of which everything was made, in the days that they were made.</p>
<p><ol><li>Day #1 - Day and Night/Heaven and Earth</li>
        <li>Day #2 - The Sky</li>
        <li>Day #3 - Dry Land and Seas/Vegatation/Trees/etc.</li>
        <li>Day #4 - Sun, moon, and stars</li>
        <li>Day #5 - Birds and Sea Creatures</li>
        <li>Day #6 - Land Creatures and Humans</li>
        <li>Day #7 - God rests</li></ol>
</p>
<p>Notice the days equal a week's time. The last day is the day God rests. It is our day to rest and worship Him.</p>
<p>So, why exactly did God do all of this? He didn't want to be alone. This means He loves His creation. In the Grace Lesson, we will learn what this means for us.</p>
<p>Now, this is why God made Adam and Eve. Adam was made first, but then Eve was made from one of Adam's ribs. (Keep in mind that Eve was not yet named.) This is the reason why a male must leave his parents and become one with his wife. Genesis 2:24 says "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."</p>
<p>How does God handle them? He walks in the garden with them! They are given one command! In order to keep in Eden they cannot eat off of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. (It was in the midst of the garden).</p>
<p>Satan tricks Eve into doing it, despite God's command. Even though she did it, she hadn't sinned yet. She had been tricked. She didn't realize it was sin, but then she convinces Adam to eat it. He wasn't tricked. He wasn't deceived. He knew what he was doing was wrong. Thus, Adam first sinned.</p>
<p>When Adam and Eve see that they are naked, they hide when they see God walking in the Garden. God knows what they have done. Yet, he asks if they did it because it is time for them to accept responsibility for what they've done. It was their chance to ask for forgiveness.</p>
<p>However, instead of asking for forgiveness, they make excuses. They played the Blame Game. Genesis 3:12-13 says "And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat."</p>
<p>As a result, Satan receives curse for punishment. Genesis 3:14 says "And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of the life." (Just a side-theory -> By "Dust" did God mean humans, because Satan was feeding off of their sin? Did cause this for all snakes?)</p>
<p>Then, God speaks the first and the biggest prophecy that mankind will ever know. Genesis 3:15 says "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel." Mary (a woman), gave birth to Jesus Christ (her seed). After the Tribulation, Christ destroys the AntiChrist (Satan's seed) ("bruise heel"). In addition, at the cross, all sin was placed on Him on that cross (Satan shall bruise his heel).</p>
<p>Adam and Eve have to be punished.</p>
<p>Genesis 3:17-19 says "And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the oice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return." He is given the stress of leadership and pain in hard work, forhis own good. He must work and to dust must he return.</p>
<p>Genesis 3:16 says "Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception, in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee." She is given the pain of child birth and must submit to Adam's leadership. This is why she was named Eve, for she was the mother of all living. Genesis 3:20 says "And Adam called hsi wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living."</p>
<p>Then, God creates the standard of salvation for future dispensations: blood - Genesis 3:21 says "Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them." From coats of skins comes blood. Skin shed reveals the blood under. There was blood shed to cover what their sin had done. It was shed to hide their nakedness. Future dispensations will now require some blood sacrifice for salvation. You will find out how this applies to us today in the Grace Lesson.</p>
<p>The Dispensation of Conscience begins with Genesis 4. We'll cover that one on the next lesson in this series, October 25th, 2015.</p>
