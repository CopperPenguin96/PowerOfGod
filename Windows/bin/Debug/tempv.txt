Description: Just like most believers I work, I have a family to take care of, we are involved with our church family but am I spending quality time with God? Am I allowing the world to take my time away from the one who loves me most? TV, Social Media, Phones,Tablets, Internet.  It's so easy in today's society to read devotion's from our phones and tablets, watch church services and interact with other believers, so why is it we spend so much time doing everything but connect with God? We pick up our phones or tablets with good intentions of reading our devotion , OH but wait, let me check my email real quick, let me check to see who was on Facebook or Twitter while I slept, gotta see who texted me too! Before we know it the world has distracted us again!  Turn the TV off, put away those cell phones and tablets, dust off the original way to connect with our one true love and open your bibles today before you even get that first cup of coffee! Lord, please forgive us for putting you in the back seat of our lives.  Help us to remember what and who should be the first thought when we open our eyes in the morning.  YOU LORD, your there waiting when we wake, waiting for us to say good morning Jesus, I missed you!  In your precious name we pray, AMEN.
